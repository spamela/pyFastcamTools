# pyFastcamTools

These tools are used to read and analyse fast-camera data from MAST.
These are loosely based on Nick Walkden tools from:
https://github.com/nick-walkden/pyFastcamTools

This repository is meant to clean up those tools, develop a user-friendly wiki documentation, and make it ready for insertion into the ukaea github space
